# Parallel Programming in Python

## Why am I writing about it?
- I love Python, it's a beautiful, simple and useful programming language
- I've ever had fascination about parallelism in computing, maybe because it has always been a complex and difficult subject to me, since the times of my first class at university in Operational System
- It is not a common thing that programmers can do in their daily basis activities
- I've decided to give it a shot and learn a little bit more about concurrent algorithms
- Maybe I can help other programmers, like me, providing this series of presentations around parallel programs in Python language with lots of differents small pieces of codes to illustrate the theoretical learning
- Python is an old language (1980) and because of that offers lots of different ways to implement parallelism, but what is the better way?
- In a daily basis job I usually don't have time to learn too much in order to apply the correct one when I need
- The most important: I'm having a lot of fun by doing this, so here I go ...

## Main agenda
- Some theory involving concurrent algorithms and parallelism
- What are the concurrent features that Python offers me?
- Working with threads and primitiive locks
- Proccess approach through Multiprocessing module (since Python 2.6)
- gevent and greenlets
- Concurrent.futures module (since Python 3.2)
- Assyncio module (since Python 3.4)
- Async/await syntax for native coroutines (since Python 3.5)
